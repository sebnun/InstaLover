# InstaLover ♥️

This Mac app will like other people's Instagram photos on your behalf.  
The photos targeted are from low population areas and with a low like count.  
When liking someone else's photos they usually come back to do the same to your photos and/or start following you.

The app will handle email and phone verification flows and temporary blocks by Instagram.  
Don't use this for spam, the default settings will try to imitate human behaviour.

You can build the app using ``electron-packager``.  
I've included a ``launch.json`` file to make debugging more pleasant in Visual Studio Code, you can debug both the main electron thread and rendered thread (react) at the same time.

Note: this app may break the Instagram T.O.S.
